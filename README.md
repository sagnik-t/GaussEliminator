## GaussEliminator
GaussEliminator is a small-time project that can be used to solve systems of linear equations using the Gaussian Elimination Algorithm(GEA). Since the Gaussian elimination algorithm is originally a qualitative algorithm that relies on human ingenuity for solving problems, this algorithm will be my own quantitative interpretation of the GEA. Any suggestions for better optimization are more than welcome.

#### Matrix Class
This project's backbone is a custom built matrix class that currently, has a few basic operations necessary for the GEA. Further operations such as Strassen' matrix multiplication can also be implemeneted.

#### References
You can find the pseudocode and underlying mathematical theory used for the GEA implementation in the [docs](docs) subdirectory. Additionally, you can find the conventions used in the pseudocode in the [conventions.md](docs/conventions.md) file.
