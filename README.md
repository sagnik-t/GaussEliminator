## GaussEliminator
GaussEliminator is a small-time project that can be used to solve systems of linear equations using the Gaussian elimination algorithm. Since the Gaussian elimination algorithm is originally a qualitative algorithm that relies on human ingenuity for solving problems, this algorithm will be my own quantitaive interpretation of the GEA. Any suggestions for better optimization are more than welcome.
#### Matrix Class
This project's backbone is a custom built matrix class that currently, has a few basic operations necessary for the GEA. Further operations such as Strassen' matrix multiplication can also be implemeneted.
